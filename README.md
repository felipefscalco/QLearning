### C# Implementation of Q-Learning algorithm to solve a defined problem

Q-learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm and values-based learning algorithm.      
Value based algorithms updates the value function based on an certain equation.

Basically an agent is placed in an environment and has to learn how to behave successfully in that environment.

The goal here is to go to the state 50 from 1.
